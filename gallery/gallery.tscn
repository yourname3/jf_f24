it takes about 5 minutes to beat from start to finish. there is no real mechanical difficulty in this--the only difficulty is the dedication of time.

should you waste your time playing a level that has no meaningful content? probably not.

however, it is not dissimilar to a fidget toy--something to idly, mindlessly do while you do smething else. is that worth something?"

the flavour of the jumps here is unlike anything else. not entirely random, but they sure feel random, and they're impossible to reach particularly high consistency on."
